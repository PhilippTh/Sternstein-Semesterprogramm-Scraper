# Sternstein-Semesterprogramm-Scraper
This is a little web scraper, that will scrape all events from http://www.sternstein.net/semesterprogramm.html with BeautifulSoup, reformat them and upload them to your google calendar with google calendar API.

To use the google calendar API, please follow his tutorial: https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/quickstart/python

When reformatting, I tried to handle as many edge-cases as I could think of. If I still missed some, please let me know.

Cheers!
